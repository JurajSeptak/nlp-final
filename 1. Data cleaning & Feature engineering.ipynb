It combines **audio attributes**, **metadata**, and **song lyrics**, making it ideal for projects like music recommendation systems, lyric analysis, and mood classification.\n\n| Column | Type | Description |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| `id` | _object_ | Spotify's unique identifier for each song.  |\n| `name` | _object_ | Title of the song. |\n| `album_name` | _object_ | Name of the album the song belongs to (may be missing for some entries). |\n| `artists` | _object_ | List of artists associated with the song. |\n| `danceability` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of how suitable a track is for dancing, based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, etc. Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.|\n| `energy` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of intensity and activity — higher for energetic songs.  Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low. Features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. Scale from 0.0 to 1.0.|\n| `key` | _object_ | Estimated overall musical key (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, ..., 11 = B). |\n| `loudness` | _float64_ | Overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB); typically negative values. |\n| `mode` | _object_ | Modality of the track: 1 = major, 0 = minor. |\n| `speechiness` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of how much spoken words are present in a track. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, including rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. |\n| `acousticness` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of whether a track is acoustic. Acousticness refers to how likely a track contains primarily acoustic sounds (as opposed to electric or electronic sounds). It measures whether the sound was likely produced by acoustic instruments like acoustic guitars, pianos, orchestral instruments, or unplugged performances rather than electronically generated or heavily processed sounds.  |\n| `instrumentalness` | _float64_ | Prediction (0.0–1.0) of whether a track contains no vocals. It's specifically focused on the presence or absence of human voices, regardless of whether the instruments are acoustic or electronic. A high instrumentalness value (closer to 1.0) suggests the track is primarily instrumental with no vocals |\n| `liveness` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of the presence of an audience in the recording (higher means more \"live\"). |\n| `valence` | _float64_ | Measure (0.0–1.0) of musical positiveness or happiness. |\n| `tempo` | _float64_ | Estimated tempo (beats per minute). |\n| `duration_ms` | _float64_ | Duration of the song in milliseconds. |\n| `lyrics` | _object_ | Full lyrics of the song (if available).
